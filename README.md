# UniVerse — Campus Event Intelligence Platform

UniVerse is a gamified event discovery and intelligence platform designed specifically for campus life. It helps students navigate overwhelming schedules, prioritize high-impact opportunities, and visualize their social and academic growth through a premium, interactive interface.

## 🚀 The Problem We're Solving

Campus life is filled with hundreds of events — from tech workshops and sports trials to cultural fests and networking circles. Students often face three major challenges:
1. **The Choice Paralysis**: Too many events happening at the same time.
2. **Hidden Impact**: Not knowing which event actually contributes to their personal development or "Aura."
3. **Logistical Friction**: Hard-to-navigate maps and boring, static schedules.

**UniVerse solves this by introducing "Event Intelligence."**

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Unified Event Feed with "Regret Score"
Every event is assigned an **Impact Score (Regret Score)**. This metric tells you how much you'd "regret" missing an event based on its rarity, popularity, and alignment with your interests.
- **Availability Real-time**: See exactly how many slots are left (e.g., "Only 12 slots remaining!").
- **Dynamic Goals**: Events are tagged with goals like "Leadership," "Skill Growth," or "Social Networking."

### 2. "Tough Choice" Clash Assistant
When two events overlap, UniVerse doesn't just show a warning — it helps you decide.
- **AI-Powered Comparison**: Compares clashing events side-by-side.
- **Decision Engine**: Highlighting the "Higher Impact" event to help you commit without FOMO.
- **Automatic Handling**: When you switch events, the assistant automatically moves the other to your "Interested" list for later.

### 3. Spatial Campus Map (Architectural View)
Forget boring satellite maps. UniVerse features a hand-drawn **architectural schematic** of the campus.
- **Building Landmarks**: Resident halls, Academic blocks, and Sports arenas are clearly defined.
- **Live Event Pins**: See where events are happening in real-time relative to your location.

### 4. Vertical Gamified Roadmap
Every event commitment is a journey. Our **Vertical Roadmap** makes progression feel like leveling up in a game.
- **Unit Progress**: Track your completion rate for different event "Units."
- **Milestone Nodes**: Earn Aura points (Flash), unlock Rewards (Gift), and clear activities (Checkmark).
- **Zone Chapters**: The journey is divided into logical zones like the "Social Quad" or "Academic Tier."

### 5. The Aura Ecosystem
Your profile isn't just a bio — it's your **Campus Impact Identity**.
- **Aura Points**: Rewarding Consistency, Diversity, and Follow-through.
- **Streaks & Badges**: Earn "Early Bird" or "Tech Guru" badges for your engagement patterns.
- **Leaderboards**: See how your "Aura" ranks against your peers across the campus.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
UniVerse uses a **"Forest Green + Soft Pastel"** aesthetic. We prioritize:
- **Large Rounded UI Components** (20px-32px radius) for a premium, friendly feel.
- **Vibrant Micro-animations** for every button press and state transition.
- **Glassmorphic Overlays** for map and detail views.
